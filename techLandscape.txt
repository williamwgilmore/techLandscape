I chose this job because the requirements were pretty low to some of the others I saw. This would be a good entry level
job to build on my experiences from bootcamp, and it seems like they are flexabile and would hire an underqualified 
person who can prove they have a good base of knowledge.

This is a freelance job, which I find interesting because it hasn't been an option so far. I found it reassuring that the
skills we are working on in class are many of the requirements - a portfolio, CSS, HTML, and Jquery. It was reassuring to
see how many postings like this I found just on craigslist.
